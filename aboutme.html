<p>Welcome to my website! My name is Raheem Mahmood and I’m currently a Junior at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. My major is Information Technology with a concentration in Management Information Systems. I will be graduating with my Bachelor’s of Science in December 2023. My major interests within this field include software engineering, data analyst and quality assurance.</p>

        <p>Throughout my university career I was exposed to multiple coding languages and have become more familiar working with them through the various projects I completed in my courses. I am proficient in Java, Python, SQL and PHP . I have worked on independent coding projects and in team projects which has provided me with project management and collaboration skills. I have gained both technical and people skills at NJIT which will benefit me in my profession. </p>

    <p>Aside from coding, I take an interest in sports. Some of my favorite sports to both watch and play include basketball, cricket and football. I am by no means a professional in any of these sports but I enjoy playing leisurely with my friends and family. I also spent some time coaching a local youth basketball team during my freetime. I also enjoy spending time with friends and family, some of the activities we do together including bowling, playing catan and gaming.</p>

        <p>I gained some experience in software engineering this past summer during an internship at Optum. I was in a team with 4 other interns and we worked on a project that required us to create a website for employees to search and find data. My team successfully created this website and presented it to the director. It received positive feedback with some areas for improvement. During this experience I learned how to work in an agile environment as I had other tasks I switched over to while simultaneously working on this major project. I also become more familiar with SQL, Html, Css and JavaScript. My excellent performance resulted in an internship extension and I was able to further work on the project started in the summer.
            As I transition from a student to a profession in the coming years I hope to continue to become more proficient in all the different coding languages. I am most interested in working as a data scientist and learning how to manage different data and how to look for data.</p>
